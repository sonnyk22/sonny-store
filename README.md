Sonny's Store React/Nodejs Assessment Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) due to the limited time given.


### `PLEASE NOTE`
IMPORTANT NOTE: <br>
This assessment project has been developed for the Client-side Rendering (CSR) <br>
and the best and latest that React/Redux and NodeJS has to offer by applying the most used best-practices.  <br>
NodeJS and Express have been used to show the such application is programmed and functions in the real world.<br><br>
In the absence of MongoDB or other NoSQL databases, the response time is shown to be sufficient with such large data files that have been provided for this application.

### `Microsoft Visual Studio Code`
`Microsoft Visual Studio Code` has been leveraged to implement this project on `Windows 10 Pro`.<br> 
If you wish to debug the backend code, the `launch.json` has been setup that will allow to simply run <br> 
the NodeJS debugger in the VS Code, and then execute the `npm start` command at the command-prompt Window.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install (FIRST STEP)`
This command will install all the libraries and frameworks dependencies within the `package.json`.


### `npm run build:dev`

This command will run both the `Backend` NodeJS code (`node server.js`) and the `Frontend` code in (npm start)<br>
the the `development` mode at the same time.

It will automatically starts the application in your browser.  You can also manually Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) to view it in the browser as well.  The NodeJS/Express server will run at http://localhost:3035

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console..


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
